#     **********
#
#     Subroutine cvsrch
#
#     The purpose of cvsrch is to find a step which satisfies
#     a sufficient decrease condition and a curvature condition.
#     The user must provide a subroutine which calculates the
#     function and the gradient.
#
#     At each stage the subroutine updates an interval of
#     uncertainty with endpoints stx and sty. The interval of
#     uncertainty is initially chosen so that it contains a
#     minimizer of the modified function
#
#          f(x + stp * s) - f(x) - f_tol * stp * (gradf(x)' * s).
#
#     If a step is obtained for which the modified function
#     has a nonpositive function value and nonnegative derivative,
#     then the interval of uncertainty is chosen so that it
#     contains a minimizer of f(x + stp * s).
#
#     The algorithm is designed to find a step which satisfies
#     the sufficient decrease condition
#
#           f(x + stp * s) <= f(x) + f_tol * stp * (gradf(x)' * s),
#
#     and the curvature condition
#
#           abs(gradf(x + stp * s)' * s)) <= gtol * abs(gradf(x)' * s).
#
#     If f_tol is less than gtol and if, for example, the function
#     is bounded below, then there is always a step which satisfies
#     both conditions. If no step can be found which satisfies both
#     conditions, then the algorithm usually stops when rounding
#     errors prevent further progress. In this case stp only
#     satisfies the sufficient decrease condition.
#
#     The subroutine statement is
#
#        subroutine cvsrch(df,n,x,f,g,s,stp,f_tol,gtol,x_tol,
#                          stpmin,stpmax,maxfev,info,nfev,wa)
#
#     where
#
# df is the name of the user-supplied subroutine which
#    calculates the function and the gradient.  df must
#    be declared in an external statement in the user
#    calling program, and should be written as follows.
#
#    function [f,g] = df(n,x) (Matlab)
#                     (10/2010 change in documentation)
#                     (derived from Fortran subroutine df(n,x,f,g))
#    integer n
#    f
#    x(n),g(n)
#
#    Calculate the function at x and
#    return this value in the variable f.
#    Calculate the gradient at x and
#    return this vector in g.
#
#  n is a positive integer input variable set to the number
#   of variables.
#
# x is an array of length n. On input it must contain the
#   base point for the line search. On output it contains
#    x + stp * s.
#
# f is a variable. On input it must contain the value of f
#    at x. On output it contains the value of f at x + stp * s.
#
# g is an array of length n. On input it must contain the
#    gradient of f at x. On output it contains the gradient
#    of f at x + stp * s.
#
# s is an input array of length n which specifies the
#    search direction.
#
# stp is a nonnegative variable. On input stp contains an
#    initial estimate of a satisfactory step. On output
#    stp contains the final estimate.
#
#  f_tol and gtol are nonnegative input variables. Termination
#    occurs when the sufficient decrease condition and the
#    directional derivative condition are satisfied.
#
# x_tol is a nonnegative input variable. Termination occurs
#    when the relative width of the interval of uncertainty
#   is at most x_tol.
#
# stpmin and stpmax are nonnegative input variables which
#   specify lower and upper bounds for the step.
#
# maxfev is a positive integer input variable. Termination
#    occurs when the number of calls to df is at least
#    maxfev by the end of an iteration.
#
# info is an integer output variable set as follows:
#
#   info = 0  Improper input parameters.
#
#   info = 1  The sufficient decrease condition and the
#              directional derivative condition hold.
#
#   info = 2  Relative width of the interval of uncertainty
#            is at most x_tol.
#
#   info = 3  Number of calls to df has reached maxfev.
#
#   info = 4  The step is at the lower bound stpmin.
#
#   info = 5  The step is at the upper bound stpmax.
#
#   info = 6  Rounding errors prevent further progress.
#              There may not be a step which satisfies the
#              sufficient decrease and curvature conditions.
#              Tolerances may be too small.
#
#    nfev is an integer output variable set to the number of
#         calls to df.

# Subroutine cstep
#
# The purpose of cstep is to compute a safeguarded step for
# a linesearch and to update an interval of uncertainty for
# a minimizer of the function.
#
# The parameter stx contains the step with the least function
# value. The parameter stp contains the current step. It is
# assumed that the derivative at stx is negative in the
# direction of the step. If bracketed is set true then a
# minimizer has been bracketed in an interval of uncertainty
# with endpoints stx and sty.
#
# The subroutine statement is
#
# subroutine cstep(stx, fx, dgx,
#                  sty, fy, dgy,
#                  stp, f, dp,
#                  bracketed, stpmin, stpmax, info)
#
# where
#
# stx, fx, and dgx are variables which specify the step,
#   the function, and the derivative at the best step obtained
#   so far. The derivative must be negative in the direction
#   of the step, that is, dgx and stp-stx must have opposite
#   signs. On output these parameters are updated appropriately
#
# sty, fy, and dgy are variables which specify the step,
#   the function, and the derivative at the other endpoint of
#   the interval of uncertainty. On output these parameters are
#   updated appropriately
#
# stp, f, and dp are variables which specify the step,
#   the function, and the derivative at the current step.
#   If bracketed is set true then on input stp must be
#   between stx and sty. On output stp is set to the new step
#
# bracketed is a logical variable which specifies if a minimizer
#   has been bracketed. If the minimizer has not been bracketed
#   then on input bracketed must be set false. If the minimizer
#   is bracketed then on output bracketed is set true
#
# stpmin and stpmax are input variables which specify lower
#   and upper bounds for the step

#   according to one of the five cases below. Otherwise

# This linesearch does not perform a search at all, but takes the step
# alpha in the search direction. By default, alpha = 1.0 is the full step.
# This algorithm is intended for methods with well-scaled updates; i.e. Newton, on well-behaved problems.
# NOTE: alpha passed from outside is ignored here, but can be passed to allow
# for generic use. We use ls.alpha instead.

"""
`Static`: defines a static linesearch, i.e. with fixed step-size. E.g., initialise
with `Static(alpha = 0.3141)` for fixed step-size 0.3141. Default is 1.0.

You can also make this independent of the size of the step `s`, by using
`Static(scaled = true)`.
This will then use a step-size alpha ← min(alpha,||s||_2) / ||s||_2
